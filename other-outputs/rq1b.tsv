I see little evidence that the centre-left political establishment engages with social movements. The DNC hardly encouraged them (MeToo hashtags aside), &amp; in the UK the Labour establishment has been so antipathetic it was even prepared to sabotage its own electoral chances. https://t.co/6nPmRbMzKE	3996216161	Thu Dec 03 17:07:47 +0000 2020	[]	3	2	https://twitter.com/fromarsetoelbow/status/1334544873085612032
