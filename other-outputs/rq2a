@GeoffGroves @Callumflack4 It’s not supporting the group themselves it’s the general reason which is racism in EVERY sense not just against black people which is very much still prominent and this sort of act by the players is a great platform to promote it.

@1974wastheyear @lancasterb @JacobSteinberg It has happened proportionately FAR more to black people than white. The BLM movement is a movement for human dignity; it is a fight for one group of humans to be looked at as human after centuries of dehumanization. If you don't accept this you are part of the problem.	181680003	Sat Dec 05 18:43:59 +0000 2020	[]	0	0	https://twitter.com/JaneJohnsonBakr/status/1335293862068293633
